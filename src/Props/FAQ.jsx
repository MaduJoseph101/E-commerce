      question: "Do AllShoes run true to size?",
      answer: "Yes, AllShoes shoes run true to size. For whole-size-only styles, we recommend sizing up if you have wide feet or fall between sizes. Half-size styles, such as Tree Gliders and Tree Dasher 2s, fit your usual size, unless you plan to wear thick socks for hiking or trail running."
    },
    {
      question: "Are AllShoes shoes wide or narrow?",
      answer: "AllShoes shoes are designed to accommodate a medium to wide fit. The flexible upper materials stretch naturally to adapt to the shape of your foot for maximum comfort."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I clean and care for my AllShoes?",
      answer: "Most AllShoes are machine washable! Remove the insoles and laces, place your shoes in a mesh laundry bag, and wash on a gentle cycle with cold water and mild detergent. Always air dry your shoes—do not put them in the dryer."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the return and exchange policy?",
      answer: "We offer a 30-day no-questions-asked return and exchange policy. If you're not completely satisfied with your AllShoes, you can return or exchange them within 30 days of purchase for a full refund."
